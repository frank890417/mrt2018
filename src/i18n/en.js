    content: `Taipei City Government and Metro Taipei have initiated jointly Taipei Soundscape Program. Since 2015, this program have brought melodies to MRT stations by changing the beep sound at the gates of Taipei Metro Railway System, replacing the alert sound reminding passengers on board to get off at the transfer and terminal stations with music, and creating music pieces for trains entering the stations and creating ambient music for MRT stations. For the ambient music project in 2016, Taipei City Government invited professional musicians to create ambient music for each of the five MRT stations: Tamsui station, Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall station, Xiaobitan station, Zhongshan Junior High School Station and Daan Park Station. In 2017, we held a music competition for the first time to invite musicians to create ambient music for five MRT station: Songshan Airport Station, Taipei Arena Station, Longshan Temple Station, Xiangshan Station and Dongmen Station.
For the third stage of the program in 2018, we have chosen 10 MRT stations of different characteristics and cultural meanings to play ambient music. The stations are Nangang Station, Ximen Station, Beimen Station, Zhongshan Station, Yuanshan Station, Taipei 101 Station, Jiannan Rd. Station, Dahu Park Station, Xingtian Temple Station and Daqiaotou Station. We have also changed the competition rules. This time, we focus on finding the suitable musicians and giving participants a chance to fully understand the spirit of ambient music. As a result, all winners will participate a three-day soundscape workshop. During this time, winners may visit the MRT stations, exchange ideas with some experts and musicians, and create ambient music for the 10 MRT stations with the help of the mentors. With our theme Sound of Silence, we aim to mix the sounds of our environments by using professional music design techniques to highlight the close relations between ambient music and the design of public space. We also hope that the sounds of Taipei City can become one of the amazing memories of the travelers.`.replace(/\n/g, "<br>")

This feeling vibrates like ocean waves, full of rhythm, where your past speaks with the future, and all your memories are transformed into a mist-like existence that doesn’t leave, but envelopes around you.  At the moment of boarding, you are ready to welcome a whole new self, one that is again full of power.  For me, every journey is a process of reconstructing myself, as if I were stepping into an unknown planet, and each dialogue with myself is like the coming and going of waves.  I want to express this feeling in the music by using simplistic repetitions to create rhythm; the two major sonic lines represent the past and future.

      demo_description: `All the materials (except for 2:12 sound of pipe organ) used were sounds the artist recorded inside the Taipei Arena Station, and improvised creatively post production, then assembled with percussion and hip-hop elements around it like a collage.  The goal is to express the dynamic urban spirit of the area.  Starting from the rhyme of the busy footsteps of people, leading to the cheerful tone of trains entering and leaving the station (the main rhythm is chosen from the sound of Songshan-Xindian  line train arrival and re-arranged), in the middle the artist incorporated pipe organ to express the sense of anticipation as if going to a big sports game, and finally assembled all the elements to make a smooth end.`,

Many local residents have developed a leisurely life attitude as well as commercial, cultural, and economical habits centering the temple.  The Sanshui Street, Xiyuan Road, Huaxi Street Night Market, as well as the always busy Longshan Temple MRT station make the area even more prosperous, and always crowded with people.  Thus, I used new and old instruments to compose this piece.  I used Chinese percussion instrument and pentatonic scale to interpret the glories of Longshan Temple in the past and added electric guitar as well as other percussion instruments to emphasize on the coming of “new” and its merging with the old, the express the concept of the passing down of a cultural heritage one generation after another.`,

Once when climbing the hill of Park Quell in Spain, just as I was feeling exhausted, I encountered a handpan (a type of percussion instrument) street performer performing. Her improvisation gave me the strength to go on, it was like an oasis in the desert.  Accompanied by her music, I forgot all the toil and my footsteps became lighter and my spirits uplifted.  I really enjoyed the experience.  Music really has the power to change people’s moods believe this beautiful experience should be shared with others.  Therefore, in this piece I employed the frolicking sounds of foreigners climbing, footsteps, insects humming, leaves hustling, and more and assembled them with plucked stringed instruments like guitar and mandolin to create a light and cheerful tempo, hoping to bring to every traveler that comes to the station a relaxed and refreshed feeling.`,

Being a hub for inexpensive but delicious food, one can find all kinds of Taiwanese delicacies in the area!  To illustrate the area’s cheerful yet traditional character, in the composition of the music we used some light and fast Chinese music percussion to start, followed by the more lively, upbeat tempo of guzheng and Chinese lute to express the joy of shopping; In the chorus we used real soundtrack of erhu to illustrate the delicate sentiments of Taiwanese people’s genuine hospitality, which is our proudest ambience.  Towards the middle we added suona to emphasize on Taiwan’s unique instrument with its invigorating sound; intertwined with the sound of erhu, it’s like a dialogue between people, creating a harmonious scene to end the piece.  Every country has its good and bad sides, while Taiwan may not have a significant status in the world, but it enables its people and visitors to live and taste delicacies with happiness, a nirvana indeed.`,
