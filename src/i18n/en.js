    content: `Taipei City Government and Metro Taipei have initiated jointly Taipei Soundscape Program. Since 2015, this program have brought melodies to MRT stations by changing the beep sound at the gates of Taipei Metro Railway System, replacing the alert sound reminding passengers on board to get off at the transfer and terminal stations with music, and creating music pieces for trains entering the stations and creating ambient music for MRT stations. For the ambient music project in 2016, Taipei City Government invited professional musicians to create ambient music for each of the five MRT stations: Tamsui station, Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall station, Xiaobitan station, Zhongshan Junior High School Station and Daan Park Station. In 2017, we held a music competition for the first time to invite musicians to create ambient music for five MRT station: Songshan Airport Station, Taipei Arena Station, Longshan Temple Station, Xiangshan Station and Dongmen Station.
For the third stage of the program in 2018, we have chosen 10 MRT stations of different characteristics and cultural meanings to play ambient music. The stations are Nangang Station, Ximen Station, Beimen Station, Zhongshan Station, Yuanshan Station, Taipei 101 Station, Jiannan Rd. Station, Dahu Park Station, Xingtian Temple Station and Daqiaotou Station. We have also changed the competition rules. This time, we focus on finding the suitable musicians and giving participants a chance to fully understand the spirit of ambient music. As a result, all winners will participate a three-day soundscape workshop. During this time, winners may visit the MRT stations, exchange ideas with some experts and musicians, and create ambient music for the 10 MRT stations with the help of the mentors. With our theme Sound of Silence, we aim to mix the sounds of our environments by using professional music design techniques to highlight the close relations between ambient music and the design of public space. We also hope that the sounds of Taipei City can become one of the amazing memories of the travelers.`.replace(/\n/g, "<br>")
